(ns loop-lei-catalog.core
  "Continuous orchestrator for the cloud-itonami-lei corporate catalog:
  observe -> evaluate -> decide -> act -> record-evidence.

  Role boundary (com-junkawasaki/root `manifest/repository-rules.edn`): a `loop-*`
  repo runs cycles and must NOT own domain scoring truth. The rubric -- what
  the axes are, how they are weighted, what counts as unmeasured -- lives in
  the `catalog-maturity` library and is tested there. This namespace only
  observes real state, asks that library what is weakest, runs a bounded
  amount of work, and writes down what actually happened.

  Observation is a live read of the catalog's EDN in git (via the superproject's
  `scripts/lei-catalog-observe.cljs`). It is never estimated and never carried
  over from a previous cycle: an unreadable catalog makes the cycle FAIL rather
  than produce a plan from stale numbers, because a plan built on last week's
  coverage would look identical to one built on today's.

  Every action shells out to the existing superproject scripts rather than
  reimplementing acquisition or discovery here. Those scripts are the tested
  path, they already refuse to fabricate data or bypass bot checks, and
  duplicating them inside a scheduler is how two implementations start to
  drift."
