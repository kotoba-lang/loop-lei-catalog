;; run-lei-catalog-tick.cljs — LaunchAgent entry for the cloud-itonami-lei
;; corporate-catalog loop. One tick = one bounded cycle of
;; kotoba-lang/loop-lei-catalog: observe (live D1) -> evaluate (catalog-maturity)
;; -> decide -> act (lei-acquire | lei-contact-discover, then re-project into D1)
;; -> record-evidence.
;;
;; Why this script exists: the loop was fully written and verified but had no
;; runner. Its ledger held ONE cycle from 2026-07-25, and ADR-2607182400's
;; murakumo cell was never registered. A loop that only runs when a human
;; remembers it is not a loop.
;;
;; Why tamaki exec rather than plain nbb: the tick is deterministic (no model in
;; the loop), and `tamaki exec` records it as a real :agent.run/mode :external
;; AgentRun with the actual argv and exit code, so `tamaki status` shows every
;; tick without pretending an agent ran it. Mirrors run-toshokan-patents-tick.
;;
;; The ledger is committed and pushed HERE, not by the loop: the loop's job is
;; to measure and act, and a cycle whose evidence never leaves this machine is
;; indistinguishable from one that never ran. The child repo is synced BEFORE
;; the cycle so the append lands on top of upstream -- an append-only file that
;; diverged has to be merged by hand, and this repo forbids rebase.
